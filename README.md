development of a ppg flight instrument


## 3d printed case
for the case, there are 2 parts plus the buttons.
I printed all parts in PLA with 0.2mm layers, the lid and box with supports. For printing the buttons, make sure the first layer height is just right.

Inspiration for the buttons came from (here)[https://www.instagram.com/p/BypbXyjohMr/]

I also use a 1" dual hook & loop strap (like velcro omni-tape) to keep it fixed to my throttle.
